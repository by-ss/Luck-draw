# Luck-draw

This is a dynamic web project.

This is a website that can generate lucky draws customized by users.

First, the user inputs his/her name. Then the back end would process a randomly selected luck draw by wirting the name in a certain area and store the image processing product to a local server folder. The user will then be directed to a new page where they can see, share, or store the draw generated.
